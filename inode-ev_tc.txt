*** Test case about high inode eviction on the 5.15 kernel ***

This regression was first observed during rpm operations with specific packages that became A LOT slower to update ranging from 4 to 30 minutes [1].
The symptoms are: high cpu usage, high inode eviction and much slower I/O performance.
Analyzing the rpm's strace report and making some experiments I could replace the rpm with a script that do 3 thing:
- rename a file, unlink the renamed file and create a new file.

This test case is designed to trigger the following regression on the 5.15 kernel:
* repeated renameat2, unlink and openat system calls reach files with btrfs compression property enable.
* the combination of these system calls and the btrfs compression property triggers the high inode eviction.
* the high inode eviction causes too much work for the btrfs directory logging.
* the overloaded btrfs directory logging causes the slower I/O performance.

A simplified script is supplied.
For a more capable script, more information and more test results please refer to my github account [2].

1.   Vanilla kernels

This test case mainly covers the following vanilla kernels [3]: 5.15.32 and 5.14.21.
The 5.15.32 vanilla kernel produced abnormal results:
* high cpu usage, high inode eviction and much slower I/O performance for compressed files.
* double inode eviction and slightly worse I/O performance for uncompressed files.
The 5.14.21 vanilla kernel produced normal results and is used as a reference.
The 5.17.1 and 5.16.15 vanilla kernels [4] produced normal results which can be found at the end.

3    k5.17.1 and k5.16.15

Just for the record, the 5.16 kernel never reproduced the regression.
The real life workload to trigger the regression, the rpm package updates, were verified to work fine since 5.16~rc6 [1].
It was expected that the synthetic workload from the script also produced normal results on the 5.16 and 5.17 kernels.

4.   Simplified test script

This simplified script tries to setup, format and mount a ramdisk block device.
It creates 3 testing folders (zstd, lzo, uncompressed) and set its btrfs compression property.
For each time the script is executed, 3 tests are done and the bpftrace is started right before each test.
